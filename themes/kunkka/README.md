# hexo-theme-kunkka

A simple, responsive theme ported from Wordpress by [iMuFeng](https://github.com/iMuFeng).
Repo of wordpress version: [Kunkka](https://github.com/iMuFeng/kunkka)(Already deleted). You can visit [his site](https://mufeng.me/) to see what this theme looks like.

## Installation
In your hexo directory, execute:

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/unnamed42/hexo-theme-kunkka themes/kunkka
npm install hexo-renderer-ejs hexo-renderer-stylus --save
```

Then modify `theme` entry in the global `_config.yml`.
```yaml
theme: kunkka
```

Then regenerate your blog:
```bash
hexo clean && hexo g
```
## Notice

Currently all style designs are based on html generated by `hexo-renderer-markdown-it`. If you use the default `hexo-renderer-marked`, the styles may break.

I strongly recommend you using [`hexo-all-minifier`](https://github.com/unhealthy/hexo-all-minifier) to minify all html and scripts, to reduce your site's loading time.

## Features

#### Post thumbnail

To add a thumbnail picture to your post in index page, simply add an entry named `thumbnail` in the corresponding post's front-matter. For example:

```yaml
thumbnail: "http://domaingang.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/example.png"
```

Or refer to an image inside your own server:

```yaml
thumbnail: "/img/example.png"
```

The thumbnail picture will *NOT* be displayed in your post page.

#### SNS Label

Syntax:
```plain
{% sns [icon] [text] [url] %}
```
`icon` must exist in [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/). The third argument `url` is optional, it will make the whole element clickable.

You can use this in your posts and pages.

#### Search page

We have an isolated page used for showing search results. Our search engine is [A jQuery-based Local Search Engine for Hexo](http://hahack.com/codes/local-search-engine-for-hexo/). To use this, install dependency first:

```bash
npm install hexo-generator-search --save
```

have it configured, then set `search` in theme config to true.

#### Scripts on demand

Only required scripts are generated. You no longer need to upload lots of scripts desinged for other situations, which you don't need.

#### Footnote

To use footnote, you have to switch your markdown renderer to `hexo-renderer-markdown-it`, and enable the `markdown-it-footnote` plugin first.

We have made a special style for footnotes, just for you to enjoy.
